# Netflix Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of a Netflix dataset, exploring various aspects of the available movies and TV shows.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights into the Netflix catalog, answering questions such as:

- Who are the most prolific directors on Netflix?
- What are the most common genres for movies and TV shows?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- How can we filter and analyze the dataset based on specific criteria (e.g., finding movies with Tom Cruise)?

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is assumed to be a CSV file containing information about Netflix shows, including:

- Show ID
- Category (Movie or TV Show)
- Title
- Director
- Cast
- Country
- Release Year
- Rating
- Duration
- Listed In (Genres)
- Description

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Basic statistics and visualizations are used to understand the dataset's structure and content.
3. **Specific Queries:** The notebook demonstrates how to filter and analyze the data based on specific criteria, such as:
   - Finding the top 10 directors with the most content.
   - Identifying movies categorized as comedies from the United Kingdom.
   - Locating movies featuring Tom Cruise in the cast.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- (Potentially other libraries depending on the visualizations used)

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install pandas
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Future Work

- More in-depth visualizations could be added to enhance the analysis.
- Additional filtering and analysis criteria could be explored based on specific research questions.
- The analysis could be extended to include sentiment analysis of show descriptions or user reviews.
